# Arduino Course

This course covers working with Arduino and electronics through various hands-on projects. Each project includes the code and a demonstration video to help you understand and replicate it easily.

## Main Projects

### 1. **RC Car Control**
   - **Bluetooth Control:** Drive the RC car using a smartphone app.
   - **Obstacle Avoidance:** The car moves autonomously and avoids obstacles using sensors.
   - **Line Following:** The car follows a predefined path using line sensors.

### 2. **7-Segment Display**
   - Display numbers from 0 to 9.
   - Show a specific number based on user input from a keyboard.

### 3. **State Machine with LCD, Push Button, and LEDs**
   - Press the button once: The red LED turns on, and "Red LED" appears on the LCD.
   - Press it again: The green LED turns on, the red LED turns off, and "Green LED" appears on the LCD.
   - Press it a third time: The system returns to the initial red LED state.

### 4. **Parking System with Ultrasonic Sensor and Buzzer**
   - The buzzer beeps faster as the object gets closer, mimicking a parking assist system.

### 5. **Buzzer Tone Control with Potentiometer**
   - Adjust the pitch of the buzzer sound by rotating the potentiometer.

### 6. **Multiplication Game with LCD and Keypad**
   - A random multiplication problem appears on the LCD.
   - The user inputs the answer using a keypad.
   - The system checks the answer and displays whether it's correct or not.
   - The result is also sent to connected Arduino slave devices.

This course provides hands-on experience with essential Arduino components like sensors, displays, motors, and communication modules. It is a great way to learn the fundamentals of electronics and embedded systems!
